# Fit Pets

Fit Pets is a full stack application in which users can add their pets and respective information to track their weight and overall health.

## Background

Two months ago I had a conversation with my wife about how we would *never* get another dog because we didn't want to upset our two cats and we enjoyed the freedom of not having a pet that required so much attention. Two days later, Jack came into our lives. 

Jack is a dog.

He was a stray that just wandered to the door and decided he was going to sleep there and just wait to become part of the family. Once we took Jack in, our main focus was to get him up to a healthy weight. 

Also during this time, one of our cats, Millie, was a bit overweight.
 
 So, we've got an underweight dog and an overweight cat. I needed something to track both their weights' simultaneously. Thus, <strong>Fit Pets</strong> was born.

## Use Case
Whether your pet is overweight, underweight, or at a healthy weight, this app will allow you to keep that information--and the historical data along with it--conveniently in one place.
